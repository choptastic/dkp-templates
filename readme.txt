DKPSystem.com's Drop-In Template collection for use on our site.

Feel free to peruse the code here, modify, extend, add your own templates.

The Advanced Layout Options documentation can be found here: http://www.dkpsystem.com/guide.php?guideid=1

We're still working on a name for the Advanced Layout Options language (DKPTL - DKP Template Language), perhaps?

If you want one of your templates to make it into the main system (with attribution of course), go ahead and make a pull request.  We'll get you officially added to the list of contributors.
